    <h1>The Story So Far...</h1>
        <p>Our adventurers have returned to Trestin, an orc prisoner in tow. Exhausted from their skirmish with Kesh, <br>will they choose to 
            rest up at the inn or immediately sound the alarm about the army of monsters to the north? 
        </p>

    <h2>History Lesson</h2>
    <p font-family="monotype">The kingdom of Verin died suddenly when a calamity struck the land. A great storm of ash descended, killing crops, poisoning rivers, and turning streets black. The great army of Verin was called back from its campaign north into Gorune, but they were not enough to divert the catastrophe. No one knows what brought the killing ash from the east, and no one knows what ended it. A year after the first fall, it stopped, leaving a crippled land. Rebuilding was slow, and many said Verinia would never recover.
        One hundred years have passed.
        Today, the coast of Old Verin flourishes with the prosperity of its fertile fields, but it’s dynastic strength never rekindled. The Kings and Queens of Verin flow from a bloodline that threatens to dry with every new generation. The current king, Volstig III, has grown old quickly, and there are whispers of consumption at court. Even after years of attempts and multiple marriages, the king has no legitimate children. In this coming power vacuum, the nobility jockey for position. 
        It is a time of worry and strife for the common person. Larger than normal garrisons are mustered and fortifications are constructed as neighboring barons sharpen their knives and examine each others’ lands with proprietory eyes. Bandits and highwaymen have become increasingly common on these borders as the land begins to segment. For those with an eye for opportunity, a good story, or just a thrilling adventure, the smell of potential is thick in the air.
